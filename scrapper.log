But the phone is really premium looking. The back looks great, not clouded with 3-4 cameras. The display is amazing for the price. The phone works well with limited apps. Good for calling, texting and running online businesses through app platforms. No gaming please. Good phone for the price.'}, {'Product': 'realme', 'Name': 'Rameshwar Tayade', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Fabulous!', 'Comment': 'Nice'}, {'Product': 'realme', 'Name': 'Shamsul Hasan', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Great product', 'Comment': 'very good'}, {'Product': 'realme', 'Name': 'Jagdishbhai Dabhi', 'Rating': '4', 'CommentHead': 'Delightful', 'Comment': 'Nice Phone'}, {'Product': 'realme', 'Name': 'Jagdishbhai Dabhi', 'Rating': 'No Rating', 'CommentHead': 'Delightful', 'Comment': 'Nice Phone'}]
